	<h2>Basic Description</h2>

	<h3>Mythic Package File (.uop)</h3>
	<p>It is a package containing compressed files. Package is divided into blocks, each holding up to 1000 files. 
	This makes it easier for client to quickly access a file within a package. Since package doesn't contain file 
	names, client has to hash a file name before accessing it.</p>
	<h3>Mythic Package Editor</h3>	
	<p>This is the basic look of the Mythic Package Editor.</p>

			<b>File view:</b> Here all the files from selected block are displayed. This is where dictionary comes into play.
			<p>Dictionary contains hashes and matching file names. When one opens (clicks on Block_x) a block, it searches for a 
			file name in a dictionary. If it finds it, actual name is displayed in file view. If it doesn't, it displays default name, 
			which is <i>Index_X</i>.</p>
